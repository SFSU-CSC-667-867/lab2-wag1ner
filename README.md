    - http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/
    - `pm2 start <filename>`
- Create a second express app with a single enpoint that returns "hello world", or some other data of your choice
- install axios with `npm install axios`
- create a route that that makes a get request to the second app and concatiates it with a user provided parameter to return one single string
- Have them print some information about the request, and watch it with `pm2 monit`
- Finally, with a partner, switch secondary servers so that requests going to partner A's main server uses partner B's secondary server. You will need to know eachotehrs ip addresses.
